# AI Prop Hunt Game 🎮🧠

A Unity-based AI-driven **Prop Hunt** game where the player must seek and catch AI-controlled Hiders that can disguise themselves as props in the environment. Built using Unity and ML-Agents, the game showcases the use of reinforcement learning to develop intelligent hiding behavior.

## 🕹️ Game Overview

In this AI Prop Hunt game:

- **You play as the Seeker**, navigating the map to find and catch hidden Hiders.
- **Hiders are AI agents** trained using Unity ML-Agents. They disguise themselves as props and attempt to stay undetected.
- The Hiders:
  - Use ray perception sensors to detect nearby props.
  - Can transform into props at optimal times to avoid detection.
  - Learn to choose strategic positions and timings using reinforcement learning.

The Seeker:
- Uses a **NavMeshAgent** to patrol.
- Detects Hiders based on movement and raycast analysis.
- Chases and catches Hiders by colliding with them.
