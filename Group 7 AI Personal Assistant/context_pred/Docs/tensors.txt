inside of pytorch to generate tensors randomly by, lets say

randint = torch.randint(-100, 100, (6,))
creates tensors of 1 row and 6 columns that contains integers anywhere between -100 and 100

randint = torch.randint(-100, 100, (2,3))

now, the third (2, 3) indicates the shape as 2D tensors that is 2 by 3 in dimension
It can be extended to 3D by defining the shape as: (x , y, z)
