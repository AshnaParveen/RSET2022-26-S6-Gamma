logits are the probability distribution of what needs to be predicted.

Consider the bigrams ab, ac and ad,

[ 2, 4, 6 ]

total is 12, after Normalizing:
[ 0.16, 0.33, 0.50 ]

now, arranging the bigrams as per the given order,

[ 0.16, 0.33, 0.50 ]
   ab,   ac,   ad

it is clear from the above arrangement that ad has the highest chance of appearnace
