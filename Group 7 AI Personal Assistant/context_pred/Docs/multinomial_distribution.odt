generalization of the binomial distribution for more than two possible outcomes.
describes the probability of obtaining a certain number of occurrences for each category in a fixed number of trials, where each trial has multiple possible outcomes.
A multinomial distribution models the probability of counts for multiple categories when each trial has exactly one of the possible outcomes.


Example
If you roll a 6-sided die 10 times and count how often each face appears, the outcomes follow a multinomial distribution with 
𝑘=6 and 𝑛=10, assuming each face has an equal probability of 𝑝=1/6.

Relation to Binomial Distribution
If k=2 (i.e., only two possible outcomes), the multinomial distribution reduces to a binomial distribution.

Usage in Machine Learning & Statistics
Text Classification: The frequency of different words in a document follows a multinomial distribution.
Reinforcement Learning: Choosing actions from a set of discrete choices.
