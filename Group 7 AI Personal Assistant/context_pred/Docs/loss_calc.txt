For a vocabulary size of 80
and let's say that we have provided no training followed by assigning random weights and so on
Then the chance of predicting the right ch in the sequence is 1/80.

To find the loss, we consider -ln(1/80), i.e., around 4.382, which is terrible :(

The aim is to minimize the loss and increase the prediction accuracy !!

one of the optimizer is gradient_descent
it is important to have an ideal learning rate too
